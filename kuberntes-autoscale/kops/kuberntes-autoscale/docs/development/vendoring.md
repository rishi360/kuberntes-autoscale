# Vendoring Go dependencies

kops uses [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) to manage vendored
dependencies.

## Prerequisites

The following software must be installed prior to running the
update commands:

* [bazel](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel)
* [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)
* [hg](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/Download)

## Adding a dependency to the vendor directory

The `dep` tool will manage required dependencies based on the imports
found in the source code. Follow these steps to run the update process:

1. Add the desired import to a `.go` file.
1. Run `make dep-ensure` to start the update process. If this step is
successful, the imported dependency will be added to the `vendor`
subdirectory.
1. Commit any changes, including changes to the `vendor` directory,
`Gopkg.lock` and `Gopkg.toml`.
1. Open a pull request with these changes separately from other work
so that it is easier to review.
