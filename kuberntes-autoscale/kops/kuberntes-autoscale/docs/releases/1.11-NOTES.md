## Release notes for kops 1.11 series

# Significant changes

* kops will attempt to remove NLBs (also known as ELB v2) that are
  tagged as created by the cluster.  Please double-check the preview
  from `kops delete cluster` before allowing deletion.

* JSON & YAML field names in the kops objects are case-sensitive.
  This was a regression across the kubernetes API libraries as
  observed [kubernetes#64612](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/64612).
  Please double-check that you are using the correct field names if
  you are constructing YAML / JSON outside of kops.
